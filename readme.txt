You MUST turn this “ON” if it is a sponsored Guest Post

You can set different prices per Guest Post.

Option to enter the payment due date for individual Guest Posts.

= Payment Status =
Option to change the payment status to “PAID” or “UNPAID” at any time.

If you need to mark the post as “Sponsored”, you can enter custom text that will show above or below the content on the frontend.

On the All Posts listing page, you can view all current Guest Posts and current Guest Posts where payments are due.

Options include “PENDING”, “DRAFT” and “PUBLISH”. With the PRO version, you can decide what to do once the due date for payment has passed. 
 
Example 1: You can Unpublish the article and send it to “Pending” mode. 
Example 2: You can Unpublish the article and send it into “Draft” mode. 
Example 3: You can keep the article published. This is useful for a client who always pays but might be outside of your set payment or publishing guidelines.

There will be an email field in each post plugin setting where you can input your clients’ email. If they haven’t paid by the due date you enter, they will receive a payment reminder to let them know that their article has been unpublished due to non-payment (if your post status is set to “pending” or “draft”. This will remind them to pay immediately so that they can have their post republished. Once paid, go back and mark their post as “PAID” and republish their article.

= User Restrictions =
Restrict other user profiles from viewing this plugin module in the backend of WP. Some admins need privacy if they have writers or third party contributors they don’t want to seeing details and statistics about their sponsored content. This is already built into the pro version without need for particular settings.

This is a great feature if you’d like to have additional content mangers who are paid per post. They MUST be and admin in order to become a post manger.
